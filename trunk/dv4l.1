.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "dv4l [" options "]"
.sp
options (shortest form):
.B [\-cdvh]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dv4l
enables programs using the video4linux API to access a dv1394
(Firewire) camcorder. It pushes the video stream to an input
device provided by the
.B vloopback
kernel module.

Before starting
.B dv4l
, make sure that the
.B vloopback
module is present in the kernel.

See
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/VideoFourLinuxLoopbackDevice
(without the dash) for information about this kernel module.

Check your 1394 driver config by starting

\ \ $ gst-launch-0.10 dv1394src \\! dvdemux \\! dvdec \\!  xvimagesink

from your shell. After turning on your camera, a video window should appear.
If this works, dv4l should work as well.

Make sure that your camera is on before starting a video4linux
program.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.B dv4l
does not support adjustment of color, brightness and similar parameters.

It supports only RGB24, not grey and YUV palettes. Some V4L programs
don't work as they don't support RGB24.

It supports only a single dv1394 camera.

Kopete seems to have problems with vloopback and does NOT work
with dv4l.
