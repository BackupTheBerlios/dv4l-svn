  is no longer necessary (but there's no need to switch
  if dv4l + vloopback works for you).

  like dv4l, dv4lstart can now take command line options to
  exchange red/blue, to disable YUV, and to get debug
  output. see man page for examples

  ls -l /dev/video0 now shows the current access time instead
  of Jan 1970

  getxattr, lgetxattr have been added
